@utopia
Admin: Utopia is the most technologically advanced heavens in the afterlife. Virtually indistinguishable from virtual reality. You are interested in moving in? 

Clint: Not in the least.

@eyepyramid
Admin: A marvel of technological wonder! Our guardian records everything, to keep us safe and optimise our lives.

Clint: That sounds scary…

Admin: Not at all. It is quite handy. Besides we all agreed to terms and conditions when we got here.

Admin: Take it easy outside the city walls. It seems many of our inhabitants have gone… how should I put it… nuts.

Clint: I can take care of myself. 

Admin: Jolly good!
