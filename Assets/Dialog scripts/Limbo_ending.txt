!sprite duck: right, sad

Duck: Clint… I am so sorry…

Clint: ...that’s not even my name.

Duck: The dark energies, they are gone. But I am so weak… I fear I am not long for this world.  

Clint: Hey, hey! You can’t die when you are already dead, can you?

Duck: There seems to be more mysteries in this world than we can imagine, Clint.

Clint (neutral): I already told you that’s not-

Duck: Before I go, allow me to keep my promise.

:The duck touches Clint’s cheek and his world explodes in a white light.

:Clint blicks a few times, and suddenly find himself back on the beach where he died. 

Clint: I’m alive again! Back at this blessed, blessed beach. 

Clint: ...and my suntan might be a bit overdone...

Clint: Maybe… maybe I should become a surfer.  That way I'll get into surfer heaven next time I die.
