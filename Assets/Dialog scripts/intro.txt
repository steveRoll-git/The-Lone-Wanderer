!sprite Clint: right, cigarette

:Somewhere in a lonely and desolate place a man wakes up. A man with no name. But we can call him Clint.

!sprite Duck: left

:He is greated by a magificent and awrsome creature.

Duck: Welcome, lone wanderer.

Clint (angry): What happened? Where am I?

Duck: I am afraid you are dead.

Clint: And what are you supposed to be? God almighty himself? 

:The duck shakes its head.

Duck: Not really. I'm more of a guide.

Clint (cigarette): Fancy that.

:The man lights a cigaret and looks around  at the grey featurless landscape.

Clint: This' heaven or hell? It ain't exactly what i imagined the great beyond to be like. 

Duck: Neither. This is a place between places. A limbo if you will.

Duck: I intercepted your journey to the afterlife because you are one of the greatest gunswords-slingermen to ever be alive.

Clint: Flattery doesn't suit you. What do you want?

Duck: Corruption has crept into the different heavens. I need someone to brave their guardians and bring their souls so I can perform a ritual of clensing.

Clint: I might be a gunsword for hire, but I aint workin' for free you know. What's in it for me?

Duck: If you succeed I will let you have your life back. 

Clint: You got yourself a deal partner.
