!sprite clint: left, happy
!sprite duck: right, happy

Clint: Here you are, three guardian souls.

Duck: Thank you. Wait here while I perform the ritual.

:The duck enters an intricate ritual circle and begins channeling the heavenly energies. 

:But then suddenly!

Duck (confused): Hg.. these energies … 

Duck: They are too strong! They are trying to overtake me…! I must resist!

Duck: It s… to difficult! You have to shoot me. You have to shoot me before I am consumed by this evil. 

Clint (sad): No. No way! I… I can't do that.

Duck (sad): You have to!

Clint(angry): Then who is going to resurrect me?!?

Duck: Just do it!!... Uhharrg!!! 

:With a horrible scream the duck is transformed. His eyes glows read and his voice sounds like grinding metal... 

!sprite duck: -
!sprite antiduck: right 

AntiDuck: Moahahaahahaahahaaa! 

AntiDuck: You are too late! I have already absorbed the powers of the Void!!

AntiDuck: And with the additional power of these three guardians I will be unstoppable! I will remake all the heavens to my own desires. Bread everywhere!!

Clint: Hate to break it to you, but that sounds boring.

AntiDuck: You… you have been most helpful. But I'm afraid cowboys have no place in my new heaven!
