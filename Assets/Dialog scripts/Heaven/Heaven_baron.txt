Baron: Welcome weary wanderer! 

Clint: Howdy! 

Baron: â€¦ you are an odd one. But since you got through the pearly gates you must be worthy. 

Clint: I'm just passing through really. I'm here to meet your guardian.

Baron: Aha, here to request an audience with your maker are you?

Baron: I am afraid it will be a tad hard to see him right now. He is on a crusade and he took almost the entire village with him.

Clint: I have some questions.

Baron: Don't we all.

Thanks partner.:end

@inhabitants
Baron: For some reason most of our villagers have chosen to join the crusade.

Baron: It is of course a noble thing to fight for your god.  But I still can't shake the feeling that things are getting out of hand.

Clint: I'm here to make sure things get back in hand.

Baron: Thank God.

Clint: No, thank duck.

Baron: What?

Clint: Never mind.

@amalia
Baron: You mean GOD? You know the usual. Almighty. Just. Merciful.

Baron: Though lately he's been a bit short on the merciful part. Not that I would ever criticize!

Clint: Of course not.
