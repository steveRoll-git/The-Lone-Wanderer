!sprite villager: right

Clint: How come you haven't joined the crusade?

Villager: Just look at me! I am so small, and so weak.

Clint: You shouldn't let that hold you back. Fighting is about so much more than physical strength. 

Villager: Really? 

Clint: Yes. Besides what do you got to lose? You  can only die once right?

Villager: By the almighty, you are right! I will join the crusade! Thank you so much, stranger. 

Clint (happy): You are welcome, partner.

Clint (angry): Wait a minute...
