:The duck poofs into existence.
!sprite duck: right, neutral

Duck: Pearly gates, we have arrived at the gates of Heaven.

Clint: Figures.

Duck: It is one of our oldest heavens so the inhabitants might seem a bit strange to you. 

Clint: Compared to the other places? 

Duck: Hm, fair point. 

@heavenQuestions
?

What is so special about this place?:special,
You mentioned the inhabitants were odd?:odd,
Time to meet god almighty.: end

@special
Duck (neutral): Most inhabitants think this is the only heaven in existence, a truly special place only for the deserving. 

Duck: All other heavesâ€¦ well they must be hell of some sort.

Clint (neutral): Not surprised people think that. Hell,  it's what I thought before coming here. It is what they teach in the schools. 

Duck: You don't have to always listen to what they teach you in school.

Clint (happy): Seldom did. Got straight Fs. 
>heavenQuestions

@odd
Duck (confused): Hm, how to put it, they are old fashioned? Spears and pitchforks and that kind of things.

Clint (happy): Then my trusty gunsword gives me the advantage! 

Duck: Yes, but their guardian is also one of the strongest.
