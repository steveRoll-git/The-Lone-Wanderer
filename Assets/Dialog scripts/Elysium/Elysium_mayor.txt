Mayor: Welcome to Elysium, please leave you clothes at the door.

Clint (angry): Like hell I will.

Mayor: My what language! It is policy that all inhabitants remain naked at all times.

Clint (neutral): I'm not an inhabitant, I'm here to deal with your guardian.

Mayor: Ah, well, I guess I'll allow it. It's not that you wear that much anyway…

Clint (angry): I was. Enjoying. A nice. Day at. The BEACH!

Mayor: Is there anything I could help you with, sir?

Why the nudist policy?:nude,

Can you tell me about your guardian?:gaiamaja, 

See you later:end

@nude

Mayor: We all came into this world naked. It is only natural that we should spend our afterlife that way. 

Clint (neutral): Makes sense. But you are missing out on one of the big joys in life.

Mayor: What? 

Clint (happy): Fashion! 

Mayor: … so are you.

@gaiamaja

Mayor: Our guardian is called GaiaMaja. She is the lifeblood of the world. The force of nature.

Clint (neutral): Is she naked too?

Mayor: Not currently no. She donned her battle armor, screaming something about exterminating all life on earth.

Clint: And no one tried to stop her? 

Mayor: As I said, she is a force of nature. Hard be it for me to argue with her judgement.

@end

Mayor: Take care out there. Don't let the bed bugs bite!

Clint: Isn't that something you are supposed to say when going to bed? 

Mayor: Yes, but we do have biting bugs out there.
